# Chocoholics Anonymous

**CS300 - Chocoholics Anonymous Project**<br />
I have 4 main core models<br />
    - Member
    - Provider
    - Service
    - Report

Run Unit testing<br />

```
python3 models_test.py -v -b
```
- This will show you all the test case, and each test's result.
However, this will hide print statement


```
python3 models_test.py
```
- This will run all the test with print statement
